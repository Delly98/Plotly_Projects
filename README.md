# Plotly Projects
Here are some of the projects I have made using Plotly

## UK Constituencies Map

The first project I made in Plotly was a map of the UK Parliamentary Constituencies using a Choropleth Map. On this, when hovering over a given district, the legend will give the name of said district and the party that runs it e.g. Party = Conservative, Constituency = Dartford. Each party in the dataframe is also assigned a colour that matches their official colours, which shades the districts that colour.

Constituencies.py is in a .ipynb file on my end, but is too large to be uploaded to github. All that's needed to make it work is .show() at the end.

Constituencies.py currently is the first version of this. In future I am going to attempt to alter the size of the Map so it is more readable, and less scrolling is needed. As well as adding it to a webpage that can alternate between different elections to see district histories. Also I will research how to change the labels further to give more info.
